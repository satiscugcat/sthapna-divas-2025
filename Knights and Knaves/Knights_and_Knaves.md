Knights and Knaves

The setting is an island. Every islander will make a statement. There are two types of islanders, 'knights' and 'knaves'.

Every islander is either a knight or a knave

Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

The objective is to conclude who is a knight and who is a knave, based on the statements of several islanders. This will be done using logical reasoning.

1. A says, “I am a Knave”.

3. A stranger passed by and asked A, 'Are you a knight or a knave?' A answered, but rather indistinctly, so the stranger could not make out what he said.  
   The stranger then asked B, 'What did A say?' B replied, 'A said that he is a knave.'

At this point, the third man, C, said, 'Don't believe B; he is lying\!'
